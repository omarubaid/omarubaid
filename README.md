# Hi, I'm Omar Ubaid! 👋

I'm a tech enthusiast with a multifaceted passion that has evolved from attending master's course Statistical and Machine Learning to deep learning in computer vision and hands-on in Data cleaning, analyzing and visualizing, to currently exploring the realms of Generative AI.


## 🔍 Computer Vision

Learning about Machine Learning and the fundamentals of Deep Learning during lecture period, I then delved into the intricacies of Conolutional Neural Networks for solving computer vision tasks. Architecting, training and evaluating CNN models on mnist and cifar-10 datasets is how I had hands-on examples done on.


## 📊 Data Visualization with Python

In parallel, my expertise extends to the realm of data analysis and visualization using Python and Microsoft Excel. I have done online certifications for that attached to my Linkedin. I am proficient using pandas, matplotlib, numpy and seaborn, bringing data to life.


## 🧠 Exploring Generative AI (GenAI)

Driven by a fascination for the creative capabilities of AI, I am currently immersed in the exploration of Generative AI. Unleashing the power of algorithms to create art, music, and beyond, I'm passionate about harnessing technology's creative potential.


## 📈 Excel Data Analysis

Beyond Python, I've honed my skills in data analysis using Excel. From crunching numbers to uncovering insights, Excel has been a versatile companion in my analytical journey. It's amazing how a simple spreadsheet can reveal profound stories hidden in data.


## 🚀 Seeking Exciting Opportunities

I'm always on the lookout for exciting opportunities that allow me to apply technology to real-world challenges. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities at the intersection of technology and creativity!
